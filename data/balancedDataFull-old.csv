active_merchant,External,-1,Craig Christenson,2012-05-18T20:22:56Z,157,103,260,"2checkout integration: Add autosettle support

The current branch only supported the 2Checkout Pass Through Products
parameter set which requires that the seller mark tangible sales as
shipped before they will charge the customer. A new method c_prod method
was added to allow support for 2Checkout Third Party Cart Parameters
which charge automatically.

The default purchase routine URL was changed from the multi-page
checkout to the more popular single page checkout.

The notification took the item_id from the cart_order_id parameter
returned by 2Checkout. On sales using the Pass Through Products
parameters, 2Checkout does not return this parameter causing this method
to return nil. The method now falls back to the merchant_order_id when
cart_order_id is not passed back so that both the Third Party Cart
parameters and Pass Through Product Parameters can be used.

active_merchant,External,-1,Nathaniel Talbott,2012-07-19T18:37:42Z,60,53,113,"Ogone gateway: loosen up signature warnings

Previously, deprecation warnings were being spit out anytime a
transaction was run without a signature, and anytime a signature
strength less than 512 was used. This was a bit onerous, as it required
not just code changes, but configuration changes for all legacy Ogone
accounts. While Ogone may force all customers to start using signatures
in the future, in all likelihood they'll just make it the default for
new accounts (as they do today).

This commit does two things. First, it continues to give a deprecation
warning if no signature is supplied, but allows that warning to be
overridden by simply providing a signature_encryptor of ""none"". Second,
it dispenses with any warning regarding signature strength, since that
is still fully configurable in the Ogone backend.",https://github.com/ntalbott,https://github.com/balanced/active_merchant

* Add info about transaction results.
* Add test credit card number, provided by eway docs
  (http://www.eway.com.au/developers/sandbox/direct-payments.html)

Code:

* :order_id is not a required parameter, so remove it
* Add :address and :billing_address to required parameters, because if
  you don't pass address to gateway, you'll get:

    Error: Required XML tag(s) missing, or incorrect case used. Required tag Name(s): ewayCustomerAddress, ewayCustomerPostcode

* Remove tests for invalid expiration date and verification value.

Most help commands look like this:

  mustache me <url>   - Adds a mustache to the specified URL.

A new user to Hubot might know enough to ask him for 'help', but once
they get this, they would likely just type 'mustache me ...' without
addressing Hubot.

This would not work, since it uses 'respond', not hear, but you wouldn't
know that from this help, without reading the source.

help.coffee has even had support for replacing the 'Hubot' in the help with
running robot's name since 57f5f098d1414663f85f93af7f20f9cae1b90018.

This commit updates all the default scripts to include a 'hubot' prefix
when it makes sense.

In addition, it updates the formatting of the help:

 * only use one line (second line would be cut off)
 * don't pad - to match other help (sorting wouldn't guarantee them
   to be grouped together)",https://github.com/technicalpickles,https://github.com/balanced/hubot

While getbit/setbit worked fine together,
they did not work well when using get().
This is because the implementation of bits
leaks into how get() is implemented.  The
basic problem was that I was treating setting
bits as a number when redis actually treats
the bits as char[].  Also the bit numbering
goes left to right so something like::

  setbit foo 3 1

actually means::

  00100000

and not::

  00000100

I was previously assuming that setting a bit
was basically (1 << offset), but that's a right
to left ordering.",https://github.com/jamesls,https://github.com/balanced/fakeredis

The (undocumented) standard for the :country key in addresses is
for it to be the standard two-character code for the country.
The old behavior for Braintree Blue gateway, fixed in this commit,
was to take that field and map it to :country_name in Braintree,
which generally didn't work as expected.

Now the gateway puts :country into the :country_code_alpha2 field,
and also allows passing :country_code_alpha2, :country_code_alpha3,

but basically, we were creating closures using this code snippet
but those closures were transferred to the actual classes themselves
so you would have something like BankAccount.new.account and this
will give the last closure added for a BankAccount even if it has
nothing to do with the actual class itself.

This caused some weird errors, so the best thing to do was to just
move this piece of code and ""dynamically"" enable it for all
method requests that are essentially #{method}_uri.
